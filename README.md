## Overview

WaCalls pairs one or more WhatsApp accounts via **QR code** and lets you **place and
receive 1:1 voice calls** from any browser on the LAN. The browser microphone is sent
as **raw 16 kHz PCM over a WebRTC data channel** to the Go server, which encodes it with
Meta's **MLow** codec and injects the media into WhatsApp's **SRTP relay** mesh - and the
reverse path brings the peer's audio back to the browser.

The entire VoIP stack runs **natively in pure Go**: the MLow voice codec, **RTP/SRTP**
packetization, **STUN**, the **WebRTC/SCTP relay** transport and the `<call>` signaling,
integrated with [**whatsmeow**](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) and served to a
**React 19** client. There is **no cgo and no native DLL** - the MLow codec is a vendored
pure-Go package, so a plain `go build` produces a self-contained binary with live audio.
Peers whose clients lack MLow fall back to standard Opus on the receive path, decoded in
pure Go via [pion/opus](https://github.com/pion/opus).

Multiple WhatsApp accounts can be paired and operated side by side, each with its own
pairing QR, connection status, and history. A single account can also run **several
concurrent 1:1 calls** at once - one per browser operator - routed independently by call ID.

> **Status:** stable. Outgoing and incoming 1:1 calls reach `ACTIVE` with bidirectional
> audio, and a single account can hold several of them concurrently. Sessions persist in
> `wacalls.db` (pure-Go SQLite).

---

## How a call flows

The core is `internal/voip/call.CallManager`, which drives a call end to end. Outgoing
call sequence:

```
1. POST .../calls            → CallManager.StartCall(peerJid)
                               generates a callID, builds the <call> offer, sends it

2. Browser opens WebRTC      → POST .../calls/{id}/webrtc (SDP offer)
                               the bridge answers with an SDP answer (pion)

3. Peer accepts              → events.CallAccept → HandleCallAccept
                               server receives <relay> + hop-by-hop keys

4. Relay transport           → STUN binding/allocate on WhatsApp relays
                               ICE + DTLS + SCTP DataChannel connect (pion)

5. SRTP media flowing        → state goes ACTIVE
   ├── uplink   (you → peer): browser 16 kHz PCM (data channel) → MLow encode → SRTP → relay
   └── downlink (peer → you): relay → SRTP → MLow decode (or standard Opus for peers without MLow) → 16 kHz PCM (data channel) → browser

6. Teardown                  → DELETE .../calls/{id} or events.CallTerminate
                               CallManager.EndCall + bridge cleanup
```

Each protocol step (hop-by-hop SRTP key derivation, RTP packetization at `PT=120`/16 kHz,
STUN relay registration, relay-ack and `<call>` stanza parsing) is implemented and covered
by tests in `internal/voip` (`go test ./...`).

---

## Requirements

- **Go 1.26+**
- **Node 22+** and **npm** (only to build/run the React client)

No C compiler, cgo, or native libraries are required - the MLow codec is vendored
pure Go (`internal/voip/codec/mlow`).

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone and enter the project
git clone <repo-url> wacalls-go
cd wacalls-go

# Go dependencies
go mod download

# React client dependencies
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/server -addr :8080          # add -debug for verbose logs
```

Live audio works out of the box - the MLow codec is pure Go, so a plain build
includes it. No build tags, no `CGO_ENABLED`, no DLLs.

Open `http://localhost:8080`, click **New session**, and scan the QR shown in the browser
(it is also printed in the terminal) with **WhatsApp → Linked devices**. Add more accounts
the same way and switch between them in the sidebar.

### React client in dev mode

```bash
cd client
npm run dev      # Vite on :5173, proxies /api → http://localhost:8080
```

For production, build the static client and serve it from the Go server:

```bash
cd client && npm run build && cd ..
go run ./cmd/server -static client/dist -addr :8080
```

### Server flags

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `-addr` | `:8080` | HTTP listen address |
| `-db` | `wacalls.db` | SQLite session database path |
| `-static` | `client/dist` | Static client directory (optional) |
| `-debug` | `false` | Verbose logging (includes whatsmeow's internal log) |
| `-max-calls-per-session` | `8` | Max concurrent calls per session (`0` = unlimited) |
| `-version` | `false` | Print the build version and exit |

Calls that stay unanswered, unaccepted, or fail to establish media time out
automatically (60s ring/answer, 30s media connect), and active calls are capped at
4 hours. A timed-out call ends with reason `timeout` and releases its
`-max-calls-per-session` slot.

Ended calls are persisted to the session database (SQLite or PostgreSQL), so
`GET /api/sessions/{sid}/history` survives restarts; the table is capped at the
10,000 most recent records.

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to store everything on PostgreSQL instead of
SQLite (see [PostgreSQL backend](#postgresql-backend-optional)). Leaving it unset uses the
`-db` SQLite file.

---

## Docker

The server and the React client ship as a single self-contained image - a static
(`CGO_ENABLED=0`) Go binary plus the built `client/dist` on Alpine, ~30 MB. Images
are published to **[ghcr.io/jotadev66/wacalls](https://github.com/JotaDev66?tab=packages&repo_name=WaCalls)**.

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then set WACALLS_PUBLIC_IP
docker compose up -d        # or: make up
```

Open `http://<host>:8080`, click **New session**, and scan the QR (also printed in
`docker compose logs -f`). Sessions persist on the named volume `wacalls-data`.

### PostgreSQL backend (optional)

By default WaCalls stores everything - app sessions and whatsmeow device credentials - in a
single SQLite file (`-db`, persisted on the `wacalls-data` volume). To run everything on
PostgreSQL instead, set `DATABASE_URL`: a non-empty value selects Postgres, empty keeps SQLite.

Bring up the bundled Postgres with the compose overlay:

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # POSTGRES_* and DATABASE_URL are prefilled for the overlay
make up-postgres          # docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

`DATABASE_URL` is a standard URL: `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=disable` (keep
`sslmode=disable` for the bundled service, which has no TLS). Both the app's `sessions` table
and whatsmeow's `whatsmeow_*` tables live in that database. Switching an existing SQLite deploy
to Postgres starts with an empty database, so accounts must re-pair.

### WebRTC networking

The browser leg of a call runs over UDP, so the server must advertise an ICE host
candidate the browser can actually reach. Configure it in `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | Host port for the HTTP API + UI |
| `WEBRTC_UDP_PORT` | `7881` | Fixed UDP port all browser media is funneled through (single mux) |
| `WACALLS_PUBLIC_IP` | _(empty)_ | IP/host the browser uses to reach the server; published as the host candidate (1:1 NAT) |

On bridge networking set **both** `WACALLS_PUBLIC_IP` and `WEBRTC_UDP_PORT`. The
UDP port is published 1:1 (`7881:7881/udp`) so the advertised candidate matches the
reachable port - keep the two sides identical. Inside a container the media socket binds
only the default-route interface, so private overlay/bridge addresses are never offered
as candidates; the same image works on plain bridge, on a Swarm overlay, and on bare
metal, with only `WACALLS_PUBLIC_IP` varying. Leaving the env vars unset falls back
to ephemeral ports with interface-IP candidates, which only works on host networking
or a flat LAN. The WhatsApp relay leg is outbound and needs no inbound ports.

For production deploys (Traefik + TLS, or an existing Swarm) and fixes for no-audio or
one-way-audio issues, see [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) and
[`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Build locally

```bash
docker compose build        # or: make build
docker build -t wacalls .   # plain build
```

Removing the volume (`make clean` / `docker compose down -v`) unpairs every account,
since `wacalls.db` holds the WhatsApp session credentials.

---

## API

All `/api` routes are session-scoped and gated by the bearer token when
`WACALLS_API_TOKEN` is set. `/healthz` is the exception: an open liveness probe (no auth,
no rate limit) for container orchestrators. Events stream over a single SSE channel,
tagged with the originating `sessionId`.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Liveness probe (always open; used by the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | List accounts (id, name, jid, status, paired) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions` | Create an account and begin QR pairing |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/{sid}` | Log out and remove an account |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/logout` | Disconnect an account (keep it for re-pairing) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/pair` | Re-pair an account (emit a fresh QR) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls` | Start an outgoing call (`{ phone }`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls` | Live calls of the session (same shape as the SSE `call-list`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls/{id}` | One live call (404 once it ends or if it belongs to another session) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls/{id}/webrtc` | Exchange the browser WebRTC SDP |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls/{id}/accept` | Accept an incoming call |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls/{id}/reject` | Reject an incoming call |
| `DELETE` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/calls/{id}` | End an active call |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/history` | Ended calls, keyset-paginated (`limit` + opaque `cursor`, envelope `calls` + `nextCursor`) |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/{sid}/history/export` | Full history as CSV (RFC 3339 timestamps) |
| `GET` | `/api/events` | Server-sent events (sessions, auth, call lifecycle) |
| `GET` | `/api/openapi.yaml` | OpenAPI 3.1 contract (public; a test gate fails when routes drift) |

### Webhooks

Set `WACALLS_WEBHOOK_URL` and `WACALLS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (both required together) to
receive a signed `POST` on call lifecycle transitions: `call.ringing`, `call.active`
(reconnections may re-emit it) and `call.ended`. The payload is
`{ "id", "event", "sentAt", "call" }` where `call` is the same `CallRecord` the API
serves; the full schema lives in the `webhooks` section of `/api/openapi.yaml`.

Deliveries time out after 10s and are retried twice (waits of 1s and 5s); `id` is
stable across retries, so consumers can deduplicate. The queue is in-memory and
non-blocking: under sustained failure, events are dropped and logged, never buffered
to disk.

Every request carries `X-Wacalls-Timestamp` (unix seconds) and
`X-Wacalls-Signature: v1=<hex>`. Verify by recomputing HMAC-SHA256 over
`timestamp + "." + raw body`:

```js
const crypto = require("node:crypto");
const expected =
  "v1=" +
  crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", process.env.WACALLS_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(`${req.headers["x-wacalls-timestamp"]}.${rawBody}`)
    .digest("hex");
const ok = crypto.timingSafeEqual(
  Buffer.from(expected),
  Buffer.from(req.headers["x-wacalls-signature"]),
);
```

Reject requests whose timestamp is older than a few minutes to prevent replays.

---

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...                 # media stack: SRTP, STUN, RTP, relay-ack, codec, state
cd client && npm run build    # client type-check + production build
```

---

## Extending: telemetry and metering

WaCalls exposes two ports for observability and usage metering, both injected at the
composition root (`cmd/server/main.go`):

- `core.CallObserver`: one instance per call, created by the factory passed to
  `app.NewServer`. It receives phase marks (`core.MarkTransportSTUN`, `core.MarkTransportICE`,
  `core.MarkTransportDTLS`, `core.MarkTransportSCTPOpen`, `core.MarkMediaFirstPacket`),
  tracked allocations and goroutines, one `SrtpRecvDrop(reason)` per inbound SRTP packet
  dropped before decode (reasons: `replay`, `auth_failed`, `decryption`, `packet_too_short`;
  exported by the OTEL implementation as the `call.srtp.recv_drops` counter), and exactly
  one `End(result, reason)` when the call finishes: `result` is `completed` when media
  connected, `failed` otherwise.
- `telemetry.CallTracer`: app-level call lifecycle with session, peer, direction and
  duration (`StartCall`, `MarkActive`, `EndCall`).

The built-in OpenTelemetry implementations are enabled by `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
Exported traces and metrics carry `service.name` (`OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, default `wacalls`)
and `service.version` (the build version injected by releases; `dev` on local builds).
To stack a custom implementation (usage quotas, billing counters) next to them, combine
with `core.MultiObserver` and `telemetry.MultiTracer`:

```go
obsFactory := func(callID string) core.CallObserver {
	return core.MultiObserver(otelFactory(callID), meteringObserver(callID))
}
tracer := telemetry.MultiTracer(otelTracer, meteringTracer)
srv, err := app.NewServer(ctx, cfg, obsFactory, tracer, log)
```

---

## Security

Auth is required: the app does not boot without an admin. Set `WACALLS_ADMIN_USER` and
`WACALLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` together to seed the single admin on first start. The web UI then
requires signing in and issues an httpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie (7-day expiry) that
also carries the SSE stream (`/api/events`) - there is no open/LAN mode. Change the password from
the account menu (which revokes every other session); the seed never overwrites an existing
admin, so a UI password change survives restarts and you can clear the env vars afterward.

`WACALLS_API_TOKEN` is optional and only for automation/scripts (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`);
the UI does not need it. With no token set, the API is reachable only via the login cookie. The
`/login` endpoint has a dedicated strict rate limit on top of the global one.
Set `WACALLS_CORS_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated
list of browser origins when the web client is served from a different origin than the
API; empty means same-origin only. Every `/api` route is rate limited per client IP
(default 20 requests per second, burst 40); tune it with `WACALLS_RATE_LIMIT` (requests
per second, `0` disables). Behind a reverse proxy all clients would share the proxy
address, turning the limit effectively global: set `WACALLS_TRUSTED_PROXIES` to a
comma-separated list of proxy IPs/CIDRs (for example the Traefik container network) and
requests arriving from those addresses are keyed by the real client taken from
`X-Forwarded-For` (rightmost hop not in the trusted list, so client-supplied entries
cannot spoof it). Requests from untrusted sources ignore the header entirely, and the
`/debug` loopback gate never trusts headers. List every address the proxy actually
connects from: on dual-stack hosts `127.0.0.1` and `::1` are different sources.
`wacalls.db` holds WhatsApp session credentials
(secrets): **do not commit it** and keep it protected.
